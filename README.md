This project is a graph-based console application that models a cityâ€™s transport network. It demonstrates how data structures such as graphs, adjacency lists, and queues/stacks can be used to represent and manage real-world connections between locations. The program allows users to add locations, connect them with routes, and explore different paths within the network. It showcases how algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) can be applied to find routes or analyze connectivity, providing a practical example of how graph theory supports efficient transport system design and route management.
